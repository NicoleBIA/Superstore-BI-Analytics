## 🟦 Executive Summary

## 🟪 Core Recommendations

### 🟦 1. Implement Discount Guardrails with Margin Awareness

- Define **minimum profit thresholds** before authorizing discounts.  
- Use **dynamic alerts in sales systems** when discount thresholds exceed profitability limits.  
- Prioritize margin over volume in discount-heavy categories (e.g., Furniture).

---

### 🟩 2. Deploy AI-Powered Price Sensitivity Models

- Leverage **AI tools like Azure AutoML or Google Vertex AI** to identify discount tipping points per product.  
- Build **pricing clusters**: high-volume/high-margin, low-margin/high-risk, and discount-sensitive.  
- Integrate these models to guide **recommendation engines** in POS or CRM platforms.

---

### 🟨 3. Reevaluate Product-Level Discount Strategy

- Flag high-discount products with **negative profit trends** (e.g., Cisco TelePresence System, Furniture outliers).
- Consider **discount-free offers** (free setup, bundling) for products with consistent revenue loss.
- **Canon Copiers** highlight success cases—track which discount levels maximize both sales & margin.

### 🟪 4. Train Sales Teams on Profit Intelligence

- Visualize **risk zones and regression impacts** during discount approvals.
- Shift the narrative: Discounts aren’t always deals—they can **bleed margin**.
- Incentivize sales teams on **margin contribution**, not just top-line sales.

## 🟦 Strategic Payoff

- **Recover lost margins** in Furniture and Office Supplies.  
- **Build AI-assisted discounting logic** for better control and smarter incentives.  
- **Reposition discounting as a profitability lever**, not just a revenue accelerator.
