### 🟪 Strategic Priority
**Uncover and reduce revenue leakage from discounting at the segment level.**

The Segment Discount Analysis revealed that although row-level discounts appeared minimal (e.g., only $820 for the Consumer segment), the **actual revenue lost** through discounts was substantial — reaching **$218K**, or nearly **15% of Consumer segment’s original sales potential**.

Similar patterns were found across all segments:

| Segment     | True Discount ($) | Revenue Lost % |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Consumer    | $218,166.21       | 14.98%         |
| Corporate   | $132,734.91       | 15.36%         |
| Home Office | $74,119.24        | 13.64%         |

This diagnostic insight reveals that **segment-level discounting** is a significant and often *invisible* contributor to margin erosion.

### Recommended Strategic Actions

1. **Set Discount Thresholds by Segment**
   - Introduce policy-based discount ceilings for B2C-heavy segments (e.g., Consumer) vs. B2B (e.g., Corporate).
   - Prevent over-discounting in segments where customers are already responsive to base pricing.

2. **Implement Profit Guardrails**
   - Use `Revenue Lost %` as a guardrail metric to restrict discounts once potential revenue loss crosses a strategic threshold (e.g., 12%–15%).

3. **Link Discounts to Margin Goals**
   - Tie discount approval workflows to minimum margin thresholds (e.g., no discount allowed if expected margin < 10%).

4. **Review Segment-Specific Value Propositions**
   - Reassess whether current price sensitivity models and customer tiering strategies align with discount behavior.

5. **Segment-Level Sales Enablement**
   - Equip sales teams with pricing playbooks customized by segment:  
     *“Here’s what you can offer to Corporate clients vs. what should be limited in Home Office.”*

> **Discounts without controls don’t just reduce margins — they silently shape long-term pricing expectations.**  
> This segment-focused strategy helps ensure that discounting supports customer conversion, not profit cannibalization.
