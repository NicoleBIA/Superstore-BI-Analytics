# Getting to Know Nicole

**Nicole Reaves | Strategic Business Intelligence Studio**  
*Designing insight systems that guide smarter business decisions and reveal unseen opportunity.*

Hi, I’m Nicole — thank you for visiting my GitHub portfolio.

I am passionate about using data not simply to describe the past, but to illuminate opportunity, strengthen decision-making, and drive intelligent market strategy.  
I specialize in using data as a strategic asset — not just to measure performance, but to forecast opportunity, inform growth, and build future-ready organizations.

My focus is on delivering business intelligence that bridges operational reality to strategic growth — connecting insights to action.

What distinguishes me as a business intelligence strategist is my ability to synthesize complex datasets into clear, actionable frameworks that anticipate challenges and position organizations for long-term success.

I analyze data through the integrated lens of market dynamics, behavioral psychology, and organizational strategy — creating intelligence that moves leaders beyond reaction toward intentional evolution.

One of my greatest strengths is designing insight systems that reveal hidden risks, surface untapped market potential, and identify behavioral trends that shape future outcomes.

Grounded by a multidisciplinary foundation in communication, management, international business, and organizational psychology, I design intelligence solutions that align data-driven action with broader strategic vision and market transformation.

To support my professional practice, I earned the following certifications:
- Tableau Business Intelligence Analyst (Professional Certification, 2024)
- IBM Data Analysis and Visualization Professional Certificate (2024)
- Certified Process Improvement Specialist (SSGI, 2024)

I also have specialized skills training in:
- Excel for Business Intelligence
- Power BI for Advanced Analytics
- Business Analysis Processes
- Advanced Data Visualization
- SQL SSMS
- Strategic Project Management Fundamentals

Strengthening these applied technical skills is a foundation of formal academic study.  
I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Communication (2013), a Master of Science in Management with a specialization in International Business (2016), and completed five years of doctoral-level study in Industrial-Organizational Psychology (2017–2022), with focus on strategic decision-making, organizational behavior, and applied human insight.
