# 🟩 Technical Background & Data Design Overview

This document serves as the technical companion to the **Superstore BI Analytics – Executive Business Intelligence Report**. It outlines the underlying dataset structure, relationships, modeling strategies, and data governance considerations that inform and support the insights and strategic recommendations presented in the main report.

## 🟪 Dataset Overview 

| Table Name | Row Count | Column Count | Description |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Orders     | 9,995     | 21            | Primary transaction dataset |
| People     | 5         | 2             | Sales Rep information (Region-based) |
| Returns    | 296       | 2             | Return status linked by Order ID |

---

## 🧱 Data Architecture & Table Relationships

The data model is built around the `Orders` table as the central fact table. The structure follows a one-to-many relationship model:

- `Orders` ←→ `Returns`: Joined by `Order ID`
- `Orders` ←→ `People`: Joined by `Region`

This design enables detailed profitability, discount, and return-level analysis while preserving referential clarity and segmentation logic.

---

## 🔗 Data Modeling Approach

- **Primary Key(s):** `Order ID` in Orders and Returns, `Region` in People
- **Join Types:** Left joins from `Orders` to both `Returns` and `People`
- **Cardinality Considerations:** Each order may or may not have a return; multiple orders per region are expected
- **Tool Used:** Tableau Desktop (Relationships/Joins set within Data Pane)

## 🟦 Custom Measures & Data Enrichment

The dataset was enriched with a series of calculated fields to enable deeper financial and behavioral analysis:

| Measure / Field Name         | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Total Sales by Year`       | Aggregated sales totals by year |
| `Returned %`                | Return rate by segment/category |
| `Returned Flag (Y/N)`       | Indicates if an order was returned |
| `Average Order Value (AOV)` | Total sales ÷ order count |
| `Original Sales Price`      | Sales before discount impact |
| `Profit Margin %`           | Profit ÷ Original Sales Price |
| `Revenue Lost %`            | Discount-driven erosion from original price |
| `Sales % of Total`          | Relative sales contribution (% of total) |
| `Sales Change ($)`          | Year-over-year sales delta |
| `True Discount`             | Effective discount relative to original price |
| `YoY Growth by Year`        | Year-over-year growth rate |
| `Running Total Sales`       | Cumulative sales performance (via QTC) |

> 🟨 **BI Note – Revenue Lost vs. Profit Loss**
>
> - **Revenue Lost** reduces contribution margin because less top-line income is available to cover variable and fixed costs.
> - **Profit Loss** impacts net profit margin as it reflects all expenses deducted from total revenue.
> - While both metrics reflect erosion in performance, revenue lost hits earlier in the financial pipeline, whereas profit loss reflects the final margin impact.
>
> Understanding this distinction is key when diagnosing **margin inefficiency** versus **net profitability risk**.



## 🟢 Dataset Origin & Usage Rights

The dataset used is a **publicly available sample dataset** provided by Tableau and widely available through repositories like Kaggle and Tableau Public. It is intended for educational, analytical, and demonstration use.

- **Source:** Tableau Superstore Sample Dataset  
- **Usage:** Public domain, suitable for independent portfolio and analysis projects

## 🟣 Data Governance & Ethics Considerations

Although this project was completed in a simulated consultancy context with public data, the following data governance principles were respected:

- **Provenance:** Dataset source and public use license clearly cited
- **Accuracy:** Data integrity was reviewed during import and data prep
- **Security & Privacy:** No sensitive personal information is present in this dataset
- **Backup & Preservation:** `.twbx` file format maintained to prevent data loss during redesign or file migration

## 🟨 Data Integrity as Risk Management

In business intelligence, **data integrity is not just a technical detail — it is a core pillar of analytical reliability**. The accuracy of insights, the strength of recommendations, and the credibility of visual storytelling all rest on the assumption that the underlying data is trustworthy.

Even a small margin of error in a dataset can create substantial risk:

- 🟣 Misleading insights → Poor decision-making
- 🟠 Over/under-forecasting → Inventory or pricing issues
- 🟡 Inaccurate targeting → Missed customer segments or wasted budget
- 🔵 Reporting discrepancies → Damaged credibility or compliance risk

Although the Superstore dataset is widely used and accepted in the analytics community, this project applied **the same integrity mindset used in real-world BI engagements**:
- ✅ Validated joins and relationships across all data tables
- ✅ Applied LOD expressions to filter, segment, and flag inconsistencies
- ✅ Designed calculated fields (e.g., `True Discount`, `Revenue Lost %`, `Return Flag`) to simulate diagnostic-level financial logic
- ✅ Ensured no data anomalies skewed discounting, profit, or return rate interpretations

> 🟪 Without integrity, even the most powerful insights can mislead.
> Business intelligence doesn’t just mean analyzing data — it means **ensuring that the data is worth analyzing.**

## 🟦 Glossary of Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **True Discount** | Difference between the original price and actual sales price, reflecting real revenue lost due to discounting. |
| **Profit Margin %** | Net profit as a percentage of the original sales price (Profit ÷ Original Sales Price). |
| **Revenue Lost %** | Percentage of potential revenue forfeited due to discounting. |
| **Returned %** | Proportion of total orders that were returned. |
| **Cost per Acquisition (CPA)** | The total cost incurred to acquire a customer or close a sale, often used to evaluate marketing or sales efficiency. |
| **Cost to Profit Conversion** | A measure of how effectively a cost input (e.g., discount, promotion, marketing) translates into net profit. |
| **Negative Inflection Point** | A moment in trend analysis where performance shifts direction, often signaling decline or deceleration in key metrics. |
| **Discount Erosion** | The gradual loss of profitability caused by excessive or poorly managed discounting strategies. |
| **Margin Efficiency** | A performance measure indicating how effectively a product, segment, or category generates profit relative to revenue. |
| **Regression (Linear)** | A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. |
| **R² (Coefficient of Determination)** | Indicates how well a regression model explains variability in the data; values closer to 1 suggest a stronger model fit. |
