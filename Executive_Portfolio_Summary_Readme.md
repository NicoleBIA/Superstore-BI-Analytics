## 🟦 Business Problem

Despite steady sales growth from 2014 to 2017, Superstore faces persistent margin pressure and declining profitability driven by:

- Over-discounting across consumer segments  
- High product return rates concentrated in specific sub-categories  
- Underperforming high-cost products (e.g., Machines, Bookcases)  
- Misalignment between high sales volume and actual contribution margin  

---

## 🟪 Business Questions

- Which products, segments, and regions contribute most (and least) to profitability?
- Where are discounting practices undermining margin health?
- Which return behaviors present operational and financial risk?
- How can the business apply smarter segmentation to improve pricing and strategy?
