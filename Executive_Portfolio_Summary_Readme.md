# Superstore BI Analytics – Executive Intelligence Summary

## Project Theme and Scope
**The Discounting Dilemma: Margin Erosion, Profit Risk & Returns in Superstore Sales**

---

## 📄 Executive Summary

This project presents a strategic-level diagnostic of Superstore’s sales performance from 2014–2017, with a sharp focus on profitability erosion, discount behavior, and return risks. Rebuilt in under five days following the loss of a Tableau source file, the analysis spans 17+ visual insights and connects data exploration to real-world business strategy.

Using segmentation, regression modeling, and visual analytics, the project uncovers patterns of over-discounting, unprofitable product lines, and regional margin inconsistencies. Each key finding is linked to a supporting insight narrative and recommendation, offering decision-makers a complete view of both performance gaps and actionable paths forward.

This README summarizes the full BI intelligence journey: from business problem to data-backed recommendation. It is designed for executives, BI leaders, and hiring managers seeking clear storytelling, technical fluency, and data-aligned strategy — all in one place.

This executive briefing distills key findings and strategic recommendations from a Business Inelligene Analysis and Visualization story across 18 Superstore Performance perspectives focused on margin erosion, excessive discounting, and segment-specific return behaviors. The project serves as a model of applied business intelligence, profit risk diagnostics, and data-driven strategy layering and storytelling.

## 🟦 Business Problem

Despite steady sales growth from 2014 to 2017, Superstore faces persistent margin pressure and declining profitability driven by:

- Over-discounting across consumer segments  
- High product return rates concentrated in specific sub-categories  
- Underperforming high-cost products (e.g., Machines, Bookcases)  
- Misalignment between high sales volume and actual contribution margin  

---

## 🟪 Business Questions

- Which products, segments, and regions contribute most (and least) to profitability?
- Where are discounting practices undermining margin health?
- Which return behaviors present operational and financial risk?
- How can the business apply smarter segmentation to improve pricing and strategy?

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques Used

> **BI techniques included:**  
> - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth modeling  
> - Regression overlay analysis for sales trends  
> - Profit margin divergence mapping  
> - Discount vs. Profit correlation scatterplots  
> - Level of Detail (LOD) calculations for Return %  
> - Data segmentation by Segment, Region, Product Line, Sales Rep

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Machines & Bookcases** are consistent margin liabilities.
- **Labels, Envelopes, Paper** were small-volume, high-margin wins.
- **Consumer segment** drove highest sales but incurred highest discount loss.
- **Phones & Copiers** delivered high sales with margin risk exposure.
- **Return behavior is concentrated**, and unmanaged, risks eroding margin gains.
