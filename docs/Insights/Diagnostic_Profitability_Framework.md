### Summary  
This framework dissects the disconnect between sales volume and profitability using a comparative diagnostic lens. The analysis uncovers misalignment between high-revenue sub-categories and their true bottom-line contribution.

---

### Purpose  
To provide decision-makers a diagnostic tool that aligns sales metrics with actual value delivery â€” enabling smarter inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies.

---

### Questions Answered  
- Are our top-selling categories our most profitable?  
- Where are revenue leaders masking poor ROI?  
- Which products and regions show the strongest profit margins?  

---

### ðŸ“Š Key Insight  
Phones and Chairs dominate revenue but deliver modest profits. Copiers deliver high ROI at lower sales volumes. Machines and Tables erode profit despite solid sales. This suggests an imbalance between sales incentives and contribution value.

---

### ðŸ§  Strategic Takeaway  
Not all growth is good growth. Without a profitability lens, high-performing revenue lines can actually erode margins. This framework redirects analysis toward contribution-based strategy.
