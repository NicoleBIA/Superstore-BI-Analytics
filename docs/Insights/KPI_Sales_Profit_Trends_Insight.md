## 🔍 Trend Observations:

### 📌 **Monthly Sales Trend**
- Clear upward trend with seasonal spikes.
- Smoother acceleration vs. monthly profit.
- Regression line shows steady and significant growth.

### 📌 **Monthly Profit Trend**
- Volatile fluctuations with sharp peaks and valleys.
- A steep dip in **January 2015 (-$3,281)** contrasts sharply with a peak in **December 2016 (+$17,885)**.
- Despite volatility, trendline reflects positive growth.

### 📌 **Yearly Sales Trend**
- Strong year-over-year growth, supported by linear regression.
- R² and p-value from regression confirm statistical significance.
- 2016 was the strongest year in growth acceleration.

## 🧠 Interpretation:

> **Sales is on a growth trajectory.** Profit is improving, but with more inconsistency — requiring careful discounting, promotion, and margin strategy.

- **2016 was the pivotal year** for both sales and profit momentum.
- Volatility in monthly profit implies operational, pricing, or return-related cost spikes.
- High AOV supports profitability potential, but consistency is key.

---

## 💬 Strategic Questions:

- What drove the sharp increase in both sales and profit in 2016?
- Are there products or segments contributing to margin erosion?
- Can return behavior or discounting be linked to monthly volatility?

---

## 📌 Insight Summary:

> The business is scaling well in **sales**, but **margin discipline** will be key to sustaining profitability.

Use this trend breakdown to prioritize pricing intelligence, operational efficiency, and strategic forecasting in future dashboards.
