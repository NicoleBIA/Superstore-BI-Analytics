# ✅ Profit Margin by Category: Verification & Cross-Validation

## 🔎 Objective  
To ensure accuracy, I performed **a verification check** on my **Profit Margin by Category** calculations in Tableau.

## 📌 Steps Taken  
1️⃣ Created **a category-level Profit Margin table** in Tableau.  
2️⃣ Compared profit margin values **with overall profit margin KPI**.  
3️⃣ **Cross-verified calculations** by manually dividing **Profit by Sales at the category level** using a **separate validation table**.  

## 📊 Results  
✅ **Furniture Profit Margin:** **2.49%**  
✅ **Office Supplies Profit Margin:** **17.04%**  
✅ **Technology Profit Margin:** **17.40%**  
✅ **Overall Tableau Calculation MATCHES manual verification.**

## 🔥 What This Proves  
- The **Profit Margin by Category is correct** and reflects actual category-level performance.  
- **Variations in overall profit margin occur because of category mix effects (higher sales volume in low-margin categories).**  
- This process demonstrates **structured validation techniques in BI workflows**.  

## 🎯 BI Application  
This verification not only confirmed my calculations but also strengthened my **BI methodology**.  
It reinforced the importance of **granular data validation** and **cross-checking calculations across different aggregation levels**—a key skill for **Data Analysts & BI professionals**. 🚀
