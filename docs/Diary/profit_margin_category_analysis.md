# 📝 Profit Margin Analysis by Category: A Deep Dive

## 📌 Context & Motivation  
During my **Superstore BI Analysis**, I noticed that the **overall profit margin** seemed lower than expected when compared to **category-level profit margins**. This prompted me to **break down profit margin by category** to gain a more **granular understanding of profitability across different product segments**.

## 🔍 What I Did  
✅ Created a **Profit Margin by Category Table** in Tableau.  
✅ Compared it to **Overall Profit Margin KPI**.  
✅ **Verified calculations** using an additional profit-to-sales comparison table.  

## 🏆 Key Insights  
- **Profitability varies significantly by category**:
  - **Furniture:** **2.49%** profit margin
  - **Office Supplies:** **17.04%** profit margin
  - **Technology:** **17.40%** profit margin  
- **Overall profit margin was lower because Furniture (a lower-margin category) accounted for a significant portion of sales.**  
- **Profit mix matters:** High sales volume in a low-margin category can impact the overall profit margin.  

## 🎯 Business & BI Impact  
📌 **Why This Matters:**  
🔹 Helps identify **high-margin vs. low-margin categories**.  
🔹 Supports **strategic decision-making**—e.g., adjusting pricing or discount strategies.  
🔹 Reinforces **data validation practices** for accuracy in analysis.  

This analysis demonstrates the importance of **exploring different aggregation levels in BI** and the **impact of category mix on profitability**. **More than just numbers—this insight can influence real business decisions!** 🚀
