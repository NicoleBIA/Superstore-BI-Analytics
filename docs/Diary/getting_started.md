# 📖 Diary Entry: Getting Started – Initial Thoughts on Launching This BI Project

## 🚀 **Why I Started This Business Intelligence Project**
As I embarked on the **Superstore BI Analytics Project**, I wanted to create a **real-world business intelligence (BI) case study** that would showcase my ability to:  

- **Analyze sales performance** and uncover revenue trends.  
- **Segment customers** based on their purchasing behaviors.  
- **Evaluate regional performance** and understand geographic insights.  
- **Explore profitability metrics** to identify high-margin vs. low-margin sales.  
- **Develop interactive visualizations** that communicate business insights effectively.  

Instead of just practicing SQL or Tableau in isolation, I wanted to **connect the entire workflow**—from **data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization**—to simulate a true **end-to-end BI project.**

## 📊 **Where I Started**
I began by **loading the Superstore dataset** into **Excel** to visually inspect the data structure.  
### 🔹 Initial Steps Taken:
1️⃣ **Renamed the dataset** for clarity → `Superstore_Sample_Retail.xlsx`.  
2️⃣ **Checked for missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.**  
3️⃣ **Reviewed key columns** to understand the relationships between Orders, Customers, and Sales data.  
4️⃣ **Uploaded the dataset into Tableau** to explore relationships between tables.

## ✅ **Next Steps**
🔹 Establish relationships between **Orders, Returns, and People** tables in Tableau.  
🔹 Create **first KPI Cards** to track **Total Sales, Total Profit, and Order Volume.**  
🔹 Begin designing **Sales Performance dashboards.**  

🚀 **This marks the beginning of my BI journey, where I’ll refine my analytics skills and storytelling approach through this Superstore dataset!**
