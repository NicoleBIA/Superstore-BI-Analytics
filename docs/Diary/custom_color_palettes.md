# 📖 Diary Entry: Custom Color Palettes – Enhancing Tableau’s Visual Storytelling

## 🎨 **Why I Created Custom Color Palettes in Tableau**

As I progressed through my **Superstore BI Analytics Project**, I quickly realized that **Tableau’s default color palettes didn’t fully align with my vision for storytelling and branding.** While Tableau offers a variety of pre-built color schemes, I found that they:

- **Lacked the vibrancy and depth** needed to create visually striking dashboards.
- **Didn’t fully complement the themes** I had in mind for my dataset.
- **Limited my ability to create a cohesive visual identity** across multiple visualizations.

To solve this, I decided to explore **custom color palettes** by modifying Tableau’s `Preferences.tps` XML file. This allowed me to **define my own unique color schemes** that would enhance readability, align with industry best practices, and improve user experience in my dashboards.

## 🚀 **The Process of Creating Custom Color Palettes**

I customized multiple color palettes, but one of my favorites is **Nicole’s Vibrant Color Palette**—a bold, high-contrast color scheme designed for clarity and engagement. Here’s how I did it:

1️⃣ **Identified the Problem:** Default palettes didn’t match my data storytelling vision.
2️⃣ **Selected Colors Manually:** Picked a mix of **rich, deep, and vibrant shades** to ensure visual balance.
3️⃣ **Modified the XML File:** Edited Tableau’s `Preferences.tps` file and inserted a custom palette.
4️⃣ **Reloaded Tableau & Tested:** Ensured the new palettes were available and applied them to dashboards.

## 🎨 **Nicole’s Vibrant Color Palette – XML Code Implementation**

To integrate my custom palette, I added the following code to `Preferences.tps`:

```xml
<color-palette name="Nicole’s Vibrant Color Palette" type="regular">
    <color>#FF5733</color>
    <color>#C70039</color>
    <color>#900C3F</color>
    <color>#581845</color>
    <color>#5B12B2</color>
    <color>#120C8D</color>
</color-palette>
```

💡 **Result?** This palette introduced **rich, deep purples and high-contrast reds** that made my charts more visually engaging while maintaining a professional aesthetic.
