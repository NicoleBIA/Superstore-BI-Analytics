# ðŸ“Š Methodology â€“ Strategic Framing of Sales Insights

This document outlines how I approached the Superstore BI dataset with a business-driven mindset, focusing on:

- Uncovering insight through segmentation (region, category, segment)
- Validating significance with statistical models (RÂ², p-values)
- Connecting data to decision-making (discount erosion, return risks)
- Linking people performance (sales reps) to region-level outcomes

> This project doesn't just explore the Superstore dataset â€” it reimagines it as a platform for real business intelligence consulting. From **discounting dynamics** to **salesperson impact**, this is a senior-level lens applied to a foundational dataset.

### Key Insight Foundations

Each insight began with a **business question**, not just a dataset:

| Business Question | Analytical Method | Outcome |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Why are sales flat in the South? | Regional trendline + rep overlay | Identified rep performance issue |
| Are discounts improving profit? | Scatterplot + segment filter | Found margin risk tied to deep discounts |
| Which reps drive meaningful growth? | RÂ² mapping per region | West rep outperforms all others |
| Where do returns impact profitability? | Return filter + category impact | Flagged product categories with loss |

---

This approach ensures that every visual insight supports a **real business decision**, not just a data output.
