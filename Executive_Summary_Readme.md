---

## ⚠️ Risks of Inaction

---

## 🔢 Limitations
- No return reason or restocking fee data available

- Integrate return reason codes for behavioral trend mapping
- Run NLP analysis on customer reviews or return notes (if available)
- Expand category naming to improve specificity (e.g., split Machines)
