# 🏬 Superstore Business Intelligence & Analytics

## 📊 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Superstore BI Analytics Project**! This project is designed to analyze sales, profitability, customer segmentation, regional performance, and salesperson contributions using **Tableau** and **Excel**. Our goal is to extract valuable insights that drive business decisions and optimize performance.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop** → Interactive dashboards & data visualizations
- **Excel** → Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- **GitHub Pages** → Documentation & project diary
- **Custom XML Color Palettes** → Defined and integrated into Tableau for consistent branding and enhanced visualization aesthetics

## 🎨 Custom Tableau Color Palettes
To enhance the readability and branding of my Tableau dashboards, I implemented **custom XML-defined color palettes**, allowing for consistent color schemes across multiple visualizations. These palettes were carefully selected to align with project themes, ensuring clear and impactful data storytelling.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **Custom Gradient & Thematic Colors**: Created multiple color palettes ranging from deep tones to vibrant highlights.
- **Seamless Tableau Integration**: Modified the `Preferences.tps` XML file to define and store custom palettes.
- **Enhanced Readability & Consistency**: Ensured cohesive styling across different dashboard components.

This approach enhances **visual analytics** by aligning **color psychology** with data-driven insights, making dashboards more engaging and easier to interpret.
