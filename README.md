## Custom Tableau Color Palettes
To align the project’s visual identity with professional branding and psychological readability, I implemented **custom XML-defined color palettes**. These palettes strengthen storytelling by reinforcing key themes, highlighting segmentation, and maintaining visual consistency across all Tableau dashboards.

**Enhancements:**
- Custom gradients and deep-vibrant contrast for visual hierarchy
- Integrated `Preferences.tps` XML for Tableau compatibility
- Reinforced brand cohesion and clarity across all views
