## 📊 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Superstore BI Analytics Project** — a business intelligence and strategic analysis portfolio entry focused on uncovering patterns in sales, profitability, customer behavior, and salesforce effectiveness.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop** → Interactive dashboards, exploratory analysis, trend modeling
- **Excel** → Data transformation, pre-cleaning, and inspection
- **GitHub Pages** → Portfolio documentation, insight storytelling, and strategic recommendations
- **Custom XML Color Palettes** → Tailored design for consistent branding across dashboards

## 🎨 Custom Tableau Color Palettes
To align the project’s visual identity with professional branding and psychological readability, I implemented **custom XML-defined color palettes**. These palettes strengthen storytelling by reinforcing key themes, highlighting segmentation, and maintaining visual consistency across all Tableau dashboards.

**Enhancements:**
- Custom gradients and deep-vibrant contrast for visual hierarchy
- Integrated `Preferences.tps` XML for Tableau compatibility
- Reinforced brand cohesion and clarity across all views
